The command mvn clean compile is used in Apache Maven, a build automation tool for Java projects. Here's a breakdown:

mvn: The command to run Maven.
clean: Deletes the target directory, removing any previously compiled files and artifacts.
compile: Compiles the source code of the project, producing class files in the target directory.
So, this command cleans up any previous builds and then compiles the source code a new.
